//Would you prefer to be 'popular' or 'well-liked'? A new study from The Australian National University
//(ANU) has shown that for Cahnberra's young people, being well=liked is much more desirable than being
//popular, and being popular does not always mean you're well-liked. The study by Stephanie Hawke, a PhD
//candidate in clinical psychology at ANU, looked at nearly 200 Year 9 and Year 11 students from accross
//Canberra. It found that adolescents saw being popular and being well-liked as two very different things. and
//that young people may not see popularity as a desirable trait.
//
//The research has been released as part of National Psychology Week. It is the first Australian study to address
//the issue of popularity and what it means to young people. 'Both boys and girls agreed that many popular 
//teenagers are disliked by the year group as a whole,' saud MS Hawke. "This can be for several reasons such as 
//bullying, having  an attitude of superiority and disrupting the classrom. Those students who are described 
//as being both popular and well-liked manage to balance their high social status with positive qualities such
//as being kind and friendly."
//
//The study also found that there was a compliecated relationship between both individual and group
//popularity, and how these were perceived by students. 'One interesting finding is that popular students are 
//likely to belong to popular groups. This was contrasted with well-liked students, who were much less likely
//to belong to groups of well-liked peers,' said Ms Hawke. 'It seems that being popular is about the group
//that you fit into, whereas being well-liked is about the individual person's inherent characteristics. Almost
//all of students interviewed said that they would prefer to be known as well-liked, as opposed to popular,
//because this is a reflection of who they are as a peron.' She added that the results indicate that 'popular'
//students are not idealised in the way that popular culture sometimes portrays, and that once other students
//are aware that many 'popular' students are not lied by others in the year group, it is possible that they will
//lose the power they are perceived to have
